- ABOUT MERGING & HANDLING DATA

- FIRST STEP:
    - needs to be able to truncate text first...
    - call from js on index for data from NYT api;
    - retrieve data from NYT api;
    - populate content containers on index w. data
        - (questions here: Bulk populate & keep data invisible until activation via click on their category?);
        - (or: Populate as needed, ie on demand?... For now, we go with this...);


- SECOND STEP:
    - send data (article abstracts) to archive: 
        - create localStorage;
        - design a readable, self-explanatory object structure for archived articles;



- THIRD STEP:
    - enable import of data for reading into archive page;
    - cross your fingers for the self-explanatory structure mentioned above;
    - create a 'delete'-functionality (hidden button on each aticle box);
